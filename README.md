# Mountaineer
Algorithm for posterior emulation using walkers exploring the posterior landscape

## Requirements
* MLFundas: Basic building blocks of machine learning (ML) techniques [stored here](https://github.com/a-paranjape/mlfundas).
* PICASA: Sampling and GPR training algorithm [stored here](https://bitbucket.org/aparanjape/picasa/). (We will only use GPR training for some examples.)

## Installation
* Clone into `mlfundas` [here](https://github.com/a-paranjape/mlfundas).
* Clone into `picasa` [here](https://bitbucket.org/aparanjape/picasa/).
* Edit `paths.py`, replacing `ML_Path` with the local path to `mlfundas/code/' and `Picasa_Path` with the local path to `picasa/code/`.
